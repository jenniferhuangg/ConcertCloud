Everyone deserves to see their favourite artist.

> **Status:** üöß Pre-alpha / incomplete  
> **Prototype / Demo:** **Not available** yet

## Overview

ConcertCloud aims to help fans pick better seats‚Äîbalancing **price**, **view**, and **experience**‚Äîand plan the show with friends. The vision is a single place to search events, compare seating trade-offs, track price changes, and coordinate plans.

This repository is an **early work-in-progress**. It‚Äôs here to capture initial scaffolding, notes, and milestones. **There is no working build or prototype at this time.**

### Goals

- Price vs. experience comparison, with clear trade-off explanations  
- Seat notifications  
- Collaborative planning calendar
- Artist and venue context (bios, setlists signals, venue tips)

---

## Current State

- ‚úÖ Repo structure + initial docs
- üöß Early UI wireframes / component stubs (not functional)
- üöß Placeholder API routes (no real data)
- üöß Draft DB schema notes (not migrated)
- ‚ùå No integrations with ticketing providers
- ‚ùå No authentication / authorization
- ‚ùå No deployment target

> If you try to run it now, scripts will likely fail

## Tech Stack (planned)

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (component library TBD)
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI
